# JetBrains Horizon UI Theme

This is a port of the beautiful VSCode Horizon theme by [ jolaleye](https://github.com/jolaleye/horizon-theme-vscode) for JetBrains IDEAs. The syntax theme is a slightly adjusted version of the theme by [xShivan](https://github.com/xShivan/horizon-theme-jetbrains). The UI theme was written by myself.
